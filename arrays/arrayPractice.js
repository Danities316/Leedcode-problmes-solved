// Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

// 5. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
/*There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

*Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.


*Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
Example 1:

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

// Given an array of integers nums, return the number of good pairs.

// A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.

// HANDSHAKES IN GATHERING
// Imagine this problem like, There is a gathering organized by some guy, the guest list is [1,2,3,1,1,3].
// The problem with the guest is they only handshake with like minded people. (Like minded here is basically the digit should be same , for example, 1 will handshake with 1 only, 2 will handshake with 2 only and so on)

// So, finally we just need to count number of handshakes in the gathering. ðŸ’¯ ðŸ’¯

// (To distinguish , multiple 1's and 3's , a,b,c,d... letters are used)

// ðŸ”¥ the day of arrival ðŸ”¥

// one by one guests are arriving at the gathering

// âœ… first guest: 1

// âœ… second guest: 2
// (at this moment, in gathering hall we have 1 (2 is about to enter) , since they are not like minded they wont shake hands)

// âœ… third guest:3
// (at this moment, in gathering hall we have 1 ,2 (3 is about to enter), since they are not like minded they wont shake hands)

// âœ… fourth guest : 1
// (at this moment, fourth guest will see in gathering hall , there is one like minded guy ie(1) , so he will handshake with him)
// therefore totalHandShake = 1

// âœ… fifth guest : 1
// (at this moment, fifth guest will see in gathering hall, there are two like minded guys ie(1,1) , so he will handshake with them)
// therefore totalHandShake = 1(last handshake between 1a-1b ) + 2(current handshake between 1a-1c, 1b-1c) = 3

// âœ… sixth guest : 3
// (at this moment, sixth guest will see in gathering hall, there is one like minded guy ie(3) , so he will handshake with him)
// therefore totalHandShake = 3(last handshake) + 1(3a-3b) = 4

// Here, in code we can imagine

// given array as guest list.
// Hashmap as gathering hall
// ans as totalHandshakes.

// 7. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
// Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

// Return the answer in an array.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
// Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
// Explanation: 
// For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
// For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
// For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
// For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
// For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
